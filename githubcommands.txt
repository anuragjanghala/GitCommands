git remote - show remote servers
git remote show origin - show detailed configuration (if exists)
git remote add origin URL(HTTPS or SSH)

git push - local data to remote repo
git push -u origin main - (-u)-> upstream
git push origin main - if we omit -u we have to use 'origin main' everytime we push to remote branch


this will only list local branches:
git branch -r - to list remote tracking branches
git branch -a - to list all branches (local, loacl tracking and remote tracking) (not remote branches)


for listing remote branches that doesn't have tracking branch in local:
git ls-remote



Now to get remote branch into local repo:
git fetch origin - is used to add changes to remote tracking branch in local repo so that later we can save it on our local branch

git pull - remote data to local repo


ALL BRANCHES: remote, local, remote tracking, local tracking

remote branch -> (git fetch) -> remote tracking branch(uneditable branch) -> (git merge) -> local tracking branch

remote branch <- remote tracking branch(uneditable branch) <- (git push) <- local tracking branch

how to create a local tracking branch which will connect to remote taracking branch specified
git branch --track 'branch_name' origin/'branch_name'

after connecting we dont need to put 'origin remote_branch_name' everytime when we fetch/pull/push.

So the basic difference between local branch and local tracking branch is:
local tracking branches are connected to remote branches through remote tracking branches.
and we can check that with command:
git branch -vv - it will show us the connected all local and local tracking branches.

once we connect local and remote tracking branches we dont need to put 'origin branchname' in commands. 

If we create a local branch then we have to push that to remote repo:
git push origin 'branch_name'
